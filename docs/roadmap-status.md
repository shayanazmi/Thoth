## 2. Phase-by-Phase Status & Acceptance Records

### Phase 0: Baseline Stage (Safe Baseline Establishment)
- **Status:** **ACCEPT**
- **Objective:** Establish workspace invariants, verify uncommitted changes, identify database boundaries (`db/store.db`) and user vault files (`vault/`), and ensure zero data destruction.
- **Verification Evidence:**
  - `git status --short` verified before every phase modification.
  - Isolated temporary databases (`:memory:` or `tempfile.mkdtemp()`) utilized in all test fixtures.
  - Verified symlink behavior (`backend/backend` created by `backend/main.py`) kept intact.
  - Production store `db/store.db` and user research repository `vault/` preserved unmodified.

---

### Phase 1: Close Source-to-Publication Integrity
- **Status:** **ACCEPT WITH LIMITATIONS**
- **Original Unmet Criterion:** Source provenance, extraction failure disclosures, and claim-to-evidence relationships must survive end-to-end execution through final publication without unverified reports masquerading as validated evidence.
- **Implementation Changes:**
  - [backend/intellectual_rigour/integrity_gate.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/intellectual_rigour/integrity_gate.py): Fixed `verify_passage_locator` to fail closed on unindexed sources; enforced passage-containment check so citations must reside inside the cited passage; added overgeneralization and missing predicate checks in `evaluate_claim_support`.
  - [backend/ingestion.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/ingestion.py): Propagated `extraction_quality` to bounded evidence passages to prevent partial extractions from claiming full-text verification.
  - [backend/orchestrator.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/orchestrator.py): Scraped metadata merged into source records; reports failing claim verification receive an automated markdown caution banner (`> [!CAUTION] Research Integrity Gate`).
  - [backend/tests/test_evidence_audit_and_correctness_gate.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/tests/test_evidence_audit_and_correctness_gate.py): Implemented 16 deterministic adversarial test cases covering quotation vs conclusion mismatches, contradictory results, causal leaps, locator fabrication, claim drift, snippet-only boundaries, and overgeneralization.
- **Observed Test Evidence:**
  - `pytest backend/tests/test_evidence_audit_and_correctness_gate.py`: 16 passed in 0.92s (Exit Code: 0).
- **Explicit Documented Limitations:**
  - Automated claim support analysis operates deterministically with heuristics and language model assessments. Novel conceptual metaphors or subtle qualitative nuances require human scholarly appraisal. The system clearly labels automated verification status and never manufactures certainty.

### Phase 2: Secure the Research Handoff & Durable Task Lifecycle
- **Status:** **ACCEPT**
- **Original Unmet Criterion:** Server-enforced research approval barrier, brief version binding, active task deduplication across processes, and durable task state persistence across application restarts.
- **Implementation Changes:**
  - [backend/conversation/brief.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/conversation/brief.py): `ResearchTaskManager` backed by SQLite; server-enforced approval gate; cooperative cancellation events.
  - [backend/memory/db.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/memory/db.py): Table `research_tasks` with unique active index `(brief_id, brief_version)` on states `('QUEUED', 'RUNNING')`; atomic claim and transition functions; crash recovery reconciliation.
- **Observed Test Evidence:**
  - `pytest backend/tests/test_research_mandate_and_approval.py backend/tests/test_audit_forensic_invariants.py backend/tests/test_task_lifecycle_persistence.py`: 26 passed in 40.60s (Exit Code: 0).

### Phase 3.1: Persistent Idea & Hypothesis Artifact Lifecycle (Current Milestone)
- **Status:** **ACCEPT**
- **Original Unmet Criterion:** Connecting informal conversational thinking to persistent research development requires:
  1. Ideas and hypotheses must be persistable as first-class research artifacts.
  2. Promotion barrier: Tentative ideas formulated during conversation or thinker sparring must NOT be persisted as formal research artifacts without explicit user confirmation.
  3. Immutable revision lineage: Revisions to hypotheses must never silently overwrite intellectual history; ancestor versions must remain preserved and traceable.
  4. Integration with research briefs: Briefs must bind to promoted ideas, inherit hypotheses and thinker context, and reject unpromoted tentative ideas.
- **Implementation Changes:**
  - [backend/memory/db.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/memory/db.py):
    - Created table `research_ideas` with columns `idea_id`, `session_id`, `title`, `description`, `hypothesis`, `status` (`TENTATIVE`, `PROMOTED`, `REVISED`, `ABANDONED`), `thinker_id`, `thinker_critique`, `unresolved_objections_json`, `parent_idea_id`, `revision_version`, `revision_notes`, `brief_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Added migration in `init_db()` adding `idea_id` to `research_briefs`.
    - Implemented database helper methods: `save_idea_db`, `get_idea_db`, `list_ideas_db`, `get_idea_history_db`.
  - [backend/conversation/idea.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/conversation/idea.py):
    - Implemented core domain lifecycle module with `IdeaStatus` and `ResearchIdea` models.
    - Implemented `create_tentative_idea` (starts with `TENTATIVE`).
    - Implemented `promote_idea_to_artifact` enforcing `user_approved=True` barrier before status moves to `PROMOTED`.
    - Implemented `revise_idea` creating a child revision (incrementing `revision_version`, pointing to `parent_idea_id`) and marking the parent as `REVISED` without altering parent hypothesis text.
    - Implemented `abandon_idea` preventing further revision or promotion.
    - Implemented `attach_idea_to_brief` ensuring tentative ideas cannot attach to formal research briefs.
    - Implemented `get_idea_history` reconstructing the full chronological ancestor/descendant tree.
  - [backend/conversation/brief.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/conversation/brief.py):
    - Added `idea_id` field to `ResearchBrief`.
    - Updated `prepare_research_brief` to accept `idea_id`: validates that the idea exists and is `PROMOTED` (failing closed with `ValueError` on tentative ideas), inherits hypothesis, thinker context, and unresolved objections, and binds mutual references.
    - Added `idea_id` to `substantive_keys` in `update_research_brief`.
  - [backend/api/routes_ideas.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/api/routes_ideas.py):
    - Exposed REST endpoints:
      - `POST /api/ideas/tentative`
      - `POST /api/ideas/{id}/promote`
      - `POST /api/ideas/{id}/revise`
      - `POST /api/ideas/{id}/abandon`
      - `GET /api/ideas/{id}`
      - `GET /api/ideas/{id}/history`
      - `GET /api/ideas`
  - [backend/main.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/main.py):
    - Registered `ideas_router` under prefix `/api/ideas`.
  - [backend/tests/test_idea_hypothesis_lifecycle.py](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/backend/tests/test_idea_hypothesis_lifecycle.py):
    - 8 comprehensive tests validating tentative status, promotion barrier enforcement, promotion success, revision immutability and lineage tree retrieval, brief rejection of tentative ideas, brief inheritance of promoted ideas, abandonment invariants, and full REST API workflows.
  - [Makefile](file:///Users/shayanazmi/college/project%20based%20learning%20/langchain/thoth/Makefile):
    - Included `backend/tests/test_idea_hypothesis_lifecycle.py` in the canonical `test:` target.
- **Observed Test Evidence:**
  - `pytest backend/tests/test_idea_hypothesis_lifecycle.py`: 8 passed in 0.78s (Exit Code: 0).
  - Canonical suite `make test`: **247 passed, 33 subtests passed in 43.04s (Exit Code: 0)**.
  - Verification check `make lint`: All core modules imported successfully (Exit Code: 0).

## 3. Next Milestone: Phase 3.2 — Thinker Dialectic Convergence & Objection Translation

### Objective
Advance Phase 3 by translating substantive thinker critiques and open objections into explicit counter-evidence search parameters and hypothesis refinement suggestions.

### Required Capabilities
1. When thinker sparring produces unresolved objections (e.g. Popperian falsification criteria or Kuhn paradigm boundary objections), convert these objections into targeted counter-evidence search queries.
2. Feed these counter-evidence queries directly into the literature review search planner upon brief formulation.
3. Offer hypothesis revision recommendations grounded in discovered counter-evidence, preserving the user's agency to accept, revise, or reject the proposed modification.

### Acceptance Criteria for Phase 3.2
- A thinker critique containing an explicit falsification objection generates at least one counter-evidence query in the search strategy.
- Discovered counter-evidence triggers an inspectable hypothesis revision proposal without silently rewriting the user's persisted hypothesis.
- Full regression suite (`make test`, `make lint`) remains green.
